BIU Intro to OOP Java CheckStyle shortcut installer

# Installation:

`
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ClovisIRex/CheckStyle/master/install.sh | bash
`

After restaring the shell you will able to execute checkstyle on a .java file with the `checkstyle` command (defaults to bash).

for a different shell, zsh for example you can run:

# Note
This POSIX shell script has been tested on macOs Mojave 10.14.6. It should work on other platforms(e.g Linux) but I can't guarantee it.
